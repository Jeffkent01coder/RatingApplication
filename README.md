### The preview image on light-mode

<img src="images/rating_app_light.png" height="840px" width="420px" />

<!-- using github user content is cool but including app images in the app is even better ðŸ˜Ž-->
<!-- something else worth noting is that Android Studio prefers PNG to other image formats especially
 when generating a signed APK. I'd suggest using PNG as much as possible even when you don't need an APK -->
